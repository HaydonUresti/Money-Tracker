# Overview

Money Tracker is a program that is meant to help the user keep track of their money through budgeting.
It allows the user to create different 'accounts' where they can note money that they are trying to keep track of. For instance, if the user wanted to, they could create an account for clothing. Then they can enter the amount that they would like to budget for clothing. The user also has the option to add to, subtract from, and delete accounts.

Money Tracker is a project I created as part of my exploration of object oriented programming. C++ is a language I've never used before. My goal was to create a program that would help me explore aspects of memory management, classes and file management within C++.

IMPORTANT NOTE: In order to work, the program must be given the path to where the program is and where the accountFile will be saved. There are instructions in the program to do so.
